#### “Highly Recommend your firm for going the extra mile. Great Staff”

-- Liz Der
Operations Coordinator
Gammon International

<hr>

#### "The best thing about the team from Thomas Maintenance was the peace of mind they gave us. You knew that when they left, the building was clean from top to bottom, that it smelled good and that all the little things that matter had happened during their day -- anything in need of repair had been noted, the security doors had all been left closed, the front entrance looked inviting again."
 
-- C. Montgomery 
former president, The Greenhorn

<hr>

#### "We have enjoyed working with TMi since 1990. Always pleased with their team's attention to detail and excellent communication."

-- Bunny Porteous
Senior Property Manager
