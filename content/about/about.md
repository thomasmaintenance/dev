Since 1990 our guarantee to our clients has been to provide a professional efficient janitorial service.  A keen attention to detail is important.

### How Important is Communication?

Communication is an integral part of any successful business. We pride ourselves on our efficiency to stay in close contact with Property Managers and to act quickly in carrying out their instructions. Occasionally a concern can arise which will call for an immediate response from our maintenance people. Our janitors will report building issues such as vandalism and graffiti.

### Our Maintenance Team

We always display a courteous and friendly attitude which brings a greater personal touch to the work we do and contributes to a higher degree of client satisfaction.

### Working with your Property Management Company

Over the years we have built up a fine reputation with a number of property management companies. With recent changes to the Strata Property Act, the workload for Property Managers has greatly increased. Therefore it is important that we continue to be an efficient janitorial service.

Our company has in place liability Insurance. We are registered with the Worker's Compensation Board of B.C. We have completed the WCB - Workplace Hazardous Materials Information System (WHMIS) course to ensure safe usage and storage of all cleaning compounds used on premises. For any further information concerning our WCB coverage and insurance please contact us.
